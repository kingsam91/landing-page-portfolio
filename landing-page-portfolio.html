    <h1>Journey to code.</h1>
    <p>My name is Samson. New to the world of code and Moringa school is the hub i begin my journey of "code."</p>
    <h2>Why code?</h2>
    <p>I grew interest in programming in general from watching a friend of mine "play" on his laptop and get paid. It fascinated me how he got things done while we sat around and talked like nothing was happening. The end product was a beautiful website and i knkew i wanted to learn how to do that.</p>
